                <p class="left-line"><i>„TE-SAT is provided by Europol on an annual basis. This is the most comprehensive report on the situation and trends observed in terrorism in the EU Member States. It is based on verified qualitative and quantitative data provided by Member States on terrorist attacks, arrests and court decisions issued for terrorist offenses.
                    The EU TE-SAT 2022 presents figures, major developments and trends pertaining to the terrorism situation in the EU in 2021.”</i></p>
                <h3 class="mt-50">Key points (based on the information provided by the Report):</h3>
                <h2 class="mt-50">ATTACKS</h2>
                <p><b>Despite the decreasing number of attacks, terrorism is still a serious threat to the EU’s security:</b> The total number of completed, foiled and failed attacks in 2021 (15) is a decrease from 2020 (57) and 2019 (55). The number of completed attacks (4) was also less than in 2020 (14) and 2019 (18). Of the total 15, most reported terrorist attacks were categorised as <b>jihadist terrorism (11)</b>, followed by <b>right-wing (3)</b>. One case was associated to <b>left-wing anarchism (1)</b>, which shows a significant decrease in numbers of this type of terrorist attacks from the previous two years, 2020 (25) and 2019 (26). As for the number of completed attacks, <b>all types of terrorism</b> (listed in the <i>Report</i>) <b>show a decrease.</b></p>

                <h2 class="mt-50">LOCATION</h2>
                <p>The four completed attacks were carried out in <b>France, Spain and Germany,</b> three of them were associated to jihadist terrorism and one was categorised as left-wing and anarchist terrorist attack. In terms of the number of all (completed, foiled or failed) attacks, <b>France</b> experienced the highest number of attacks (5), followed by <b>Germany</b> (3) and <b>Sweden</b> (2). <b>Austria, Denmark, Hungary, Belgium</b> and <b>Spain</b> reported one attack each.</p>

                <h2 class="mt-50">PERPETRATORS</h2>
                <p><b>Lone actors remain the primary perpetrators of terrorist and violent extremist attacks in Europe.</b> Individuals have been associated mainly with jihadist terrorism, right-wing terrorism and violent extremism.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-50">WEAPONRY</h2>
                <p>The four completed terrorist attacks were committed by <b>stabbing</b> (2), <b>ramming a vehicle into a crowd</b> (1) and <b>arson using inflammable liquids</b> (1). These devices are relatively easy to source and do not require extensive skills for assemblage or use. IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) and IIDs (Improvised Incendiary Devices) are used by all types of terrorism, while bladed weapons are mainly used by jihadists. HMEs (Home-made Explosives) remain a preferred weapon for jihadist terrorists, however, the use of TATP (Triacetone Triperoxide) has decreased compared to previous years.</p>
                <h2 class="mt-50">ARRESTS</h2>
                <p>The number of arrests in 2021 (388) shows a decrease compared to the previous two years, 2020 (449) and 2019 (723). Most of these measures in 2021 (260) were carried out following investigations on jihadist terrorism in France, Spain and Austria.</p>

                <h3 class="mt-50">Summary and vision</h3>
                <p>In terms of numbers provided by TE-SAT 2022, the year 2021 showed a visible decrease in terrorist attacks, but it does not necessarily mean that the EU faces against lower threat level of terrorism. The findings of the Report highlight the fact that lone actors remain the most significant threat associated with potential terrorist and violent extremist attacks in the EU. These perpetrators are often difficult to trace because of their isolated life, and many of them have never had any criminal records. TE-SAT 2022 also points to the fact that the social isolation and the increased online presence caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have deepened individuals’ susceptibility to radicalisation. The restrictions and government measures related to COVID-19 in the EU states combined with online disinformation have made this issue more significant.</p>
                <p>As mentioned in the Report, the ongoing war on the European continent will also have a lasting impact on the EU’s internal security for years. Member States will undoubtedly have to deal with the increasing number of illegal weapons and violent extremist reactions within the borders of the EU.</p>
